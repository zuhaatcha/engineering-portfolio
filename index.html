    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Zuha Atcha, a Mechanical Engineer with an MSc from the University of Sheffield and a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from Istanbul Bilgi University. My work lies at the intersection of design, simulation, and problem-solving — from mechanical design and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring hands-on experience with tools like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, ANSYS, and Siemens NX, and I've worked on everything from mold design and tooling to dynamic simulations of advanced materials. Whether it’s optimizing composite materials under vibration loads or refining manufacturing designs, I thrive on turning complex engineering challenges into elegant solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My recent projects include studying the dynamic response of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers and simulating diffuser behaviors for better fluid flow predictions. With a strong foundation in both experimental methods and computational modeling, I'm focused on delivering solutions that are not just functional, but intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m always looking for opportunities where engineering, innovation, and impact meet. Let’s build something meaningful.
